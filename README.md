# chat_ssh
✔ A simple ssh chat room 👩‍💻🚀🔑📡

The one who wants to start the chat, must run "server_ssh.py", the one who wants to connect must run "client_ssh.py". Do what the programs ask for and then you can start to chat. The server's host can type -h or --help to have more information about how he can control the room. I hope you'll enjoy this simple program 👾👽🌵

and remember, always use ssh 🔒...
